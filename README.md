# matrix-calculator
Dumb calculator for matrices in linear algebra

Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, cross multiplication, scalar multiplication, row reducing (by Gaussian algorithm)

#### Console
User can input two matrices of any dimension in the format 1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9

> 1 2 3
> 4 5 6
> 7 8 9

Then input a certain command: "row reduce A". 

The calculator will then use the Gaussian-Jordian algorithm to calculate the answer and then return it as a matrix
