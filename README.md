# matrix-calculator
Calculator for matrices in linear algebra--it's that course. You know it.

Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, cross multiplication, scalar multiplication, row reducing (by Gaussian algorithm)

#### Console
User can input two matrices of any dimension in the format 1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9

> 1 2 3

> 4 5 6

> 7 8 9

Then input a certain command: "row reduce A", or perform matrix multiplication AB, etc.

The calculator will then use the Gaussian-Jordian algorithm to calculate the answer and then return it as a matrix. Works for matrices of all sizes!
